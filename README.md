## About Dataset
**Journals & Ranking**
An academic journal or research journal is a periodical publication in which research articles relating to a particular academic discipline is published, according to Wikipedia. Currently, there are more than 25,000 peer-reviewed journals that are indexed in citation index databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. These indexes are ranked on the basis of various metrics such as CiteScore, H-index, etc. The metrics are calculated from yearly citation data of the journal. A lot of efforts are given to make a metric that reflects the journal's quality.

**Journal Ranking Dataset**
This is a comprehensive dataset on the academic journals coving their metadata information as well as citation, metrics, and ranking information. Detailed data on their subject area is also given in this dataset. The dataset is collected from the following indexing databases:

Scimago Journal Ranking
Scopus
Web of Science Master Journal List

The data is collected by scraping and then it was cleaned.
