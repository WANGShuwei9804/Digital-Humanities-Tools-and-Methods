# Research 

## Topic:

An academic journal or research journal is a periodical publication in which research articles relating to a particular academic discipline is published, according to Wikipedia. Currently, there are more than 25,000 peer-reviewed journals that are indexed in citation index databases such as Scopus and Web of Science. These indexes are ranked on the basis of various metrics such as CiteScore, H-index, etc. The metrics are calculated from yearly citation data of the journal. A lot of efforts are given to make a metric that reflects the journal's quality.

I want to explore that if the journals from different countries are more specialized in some subject areas, and if this phenomenon is related to the ranking of the journals.

## Research Question:

Do journals with higher rankings in different countries focus more on specific subject areas? 
Whether there is a correlation between country and subject area, and is this correlation more pronounced in the top-ranked journals?

## Data Preparation:

Journal ranking data: rank, SJR-index, CiteScore.

Country Information.

Subject information.

I intend to use the provided dataset to extract information on journals, countries, and subject areas. And I intend to apply quantitative analysis to determine whether the countries are relevant to some specific subject areas, as well as whether high-ranking journals in certain countries focus more on specific subject areas.

## Possible tools:

**Data processing:** Use Python for data cleaning and processing.

**Correlation analysis:** Use Python's pandas to perform correlation analysis.

**Data visualization:** Use visualization tools such as maps to show relationships between countries, subject areas, and rankings.
