# Research 

## Topic:

I wanted to explore whether different countries are more specialized in specific subject areas, and whether this phenomenon is related to the ranking of journals

## Research Question:

Do journals with higher rankings in different countries focus more on specific subject areas? 
Whether there is a correlation between country and subject area, and is this correlation more pronounced in the top-ranked journals?

## Data Preparation:

Journal ranking data: ranking, SJR-index, CiteScore and others.

Country Information: the country to which the journal belongs.

Subject area information: the subject areas covered by the journal.

## Possible tools:

**Data processing:** Use Python or R for data cleaning and processing.

**Correlation analysis:** Use Python's pandas to perform correlation analysis.

**Data visualization:** Use visualization tools such as maps to show relationships between countries, subject areas, and rankings.
